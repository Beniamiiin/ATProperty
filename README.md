# ATProperty [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Draveness/ATProperty.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Draveness/ATProperty)

## What is this?

This is a convenient and fast approach to create property. You do not need to type `@property` and `nonatomic` when you declare a property.

You just needs to type `@t` like this.

## How to install?
